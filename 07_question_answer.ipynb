'context': 'To anyone who hasn\\'t tried all the various types of headphones, it is important to remember exactly what these are: cheap portable on-ear headphones. They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they\\'re good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer\\'s sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they\\'re very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn\\'t find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \"comfort zone\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn\\'t get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn\\'t catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it\\'s good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you\\'re into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I\\'ve certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I\\'d rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we\\'re talking about value, they\\'re a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you\\'re trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there\\'s really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming.

They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they're good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer's sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they're very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn't find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \\\"comfort zone\\\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn't get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn't catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it's good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you're into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I've certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we're talking about value, they're a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you're trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there's really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"How is the bass?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers.text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers.answer_start\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers.answer_subj_level\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers.ans_subj_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers.is_ans_subjective\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}],"source":["dfs['train'][:4]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"id":"ZKFW3ba2gjKh","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":233},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728802849162,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":42,"user":{"displayName":"Aman Kushwaha","userId":"01248588024895850919"}},"outputId":"18066725-0d6e-48ed-b146-af61dcf1fc7f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        title                             question  \\\n","0  B00001P4ZH                     How is the bass?   \n","1  B00001P4ZH  Is this music song have a goo bass?   \n","\n","                                        answers.text answers.answer_start  \\\n","0                                                 []                   []   \n","1  [Bass is weak as expected, Bass is weak as exp...

Very reasonably priced for the quality and features.\",\n          \"Okay we all know this isn't a replacement for a full blown camcorder and certainly not a camera, BUT it is a great product. I personally bought it for it's waterproof capabilities. It takes a DECENT still shot, more than good enough for social networks or emails. More importantly though, the video that it shoots is outstanding. Better than most I've had experience with taken by cameras, plus it's waterproof. I have mentioned that a couple of times now because I feel that is the key aspect with this product.This is a fun camera and small enough to throw in a pocket. Getting to the details on video I have to say that outdoors is where it shines. Indoor shots with normal lighting are also good but low light are viewable but somewhat grainy. Underwater video is equally good. You MUST turn that mode on. Each time the camera is turned off it resets and must be turned on again. It just compensates for the lighting underwater. I've forgotten to turn it on and the video looks good? The digital zoom is remarkably good. Usually digital zoom tends to be less than ideal but this camcorder handles it very well! Much better than expected. I don't hesitate to use it at all, even on full zoom it's good. The manual does not say what the zoom is nor does the camera. People here in the reviews have estimated and I'd GUESS 4-5x.As for the video modes 720p 30fps isn't bad. The picture is sharp and has great color. There can be some shakey almost slightly strobe light effect if you move the camera too fast. The built in image stabilization does help BUT you must turn it on. 720p 60fps is the bomb! I think this is the sweet spot and use this mode most of the time. 1080p 30fps is wonderful though you must again be careful with the camera movement. The image is just plain crisp!! Don't get me wrong this mode is great but it takes a lot of memory and isn't really practical for emailing or uploading to social networks. Looks beautiful on my 58 in. Samsung plasma.Stills as I said are good and a couple outdoor shots I took rival my better camera. Parties, walks on the beach, hanging with friends are good venues for the stills. Important parties, weddings, those moments that really mean something, no, use a dedicated real camera.Battery life is pretty decent. I shoot 30 sec. to 1 min. most of the time then power off and it has lasted through 2 serious parties 40-50 vids at each party with time to spare. Not sure if you just turned it on and let it go for like 5-10 min. vids? My guess is that it wouldn't last as long. That's the WORST way to take vids anyway!! Nothing is worse than a 5 minute or longer video to watch!! OMG, please don't ever force a vid of that length on a friend. Because you can't say anything and have to sit through the whole horrid thing. Show the same vid in 1 min or less clips and it's acceptable. Just my opinion.This has been a great purchase for me. As said the waterproof capability is what sold me. If you don't want to lug the camcorder and camera along this just pops in the pocket. It's inexpensive and FUN, buy it you won't regret itP.S. I think it's as nice or nicer than the Flip. Comparing it to my friends Flip, the vids are the same but this is WATERPROOF!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

I don\\'t get out much, so my computer is convenient for everything else.I\\'ve had several Kindles and was happy with all of them, but I had recently played around with my brother\\'s tablet. When my last Kindle died, I decided to replace it with the Kindle Fire. I chose the smaller one because I was concerned about my arthritic hands holding a larger device for long periods. The 7\" is just perfect for me. It\\'s light enough that I can hold it to read, but the larger screen compared to the Kindle makes for easier reading. I love the color, something I never thought would make a difference to me.Oddly enough, high on my favorite list is the ability to review a book as soon as I reach the end. I have written reviews of every book I read on a readers social media site, but I have seldom put in the extra effort to come to Amazon to write a review. On the Kindle Fire, as soon as I come to the end of a book, a review page pops up so I can review it while it\\'s fresh on my mind, and I\\'m reviewing everything I read.I didn\\'t realize when I placed my order that I was ordering that the device had special offers. I\\'ve always thought I would not want to be subject to advertising when I was reading. However, I discovered that the special offers are discreet and no distraction at all. I\\'ve even found myself going to the special offers page a time or two to see what\\'s on offer.The only negative is that the battery doesn\\'t last very long. However, with the PowerFast charger, it doesn\\'t take long to charge the battery.I think folks like me who have always used a dedicated ereader and never even used a touch screen will be pleasantly surprised with the Kindle Fire, and people who are used to smartphones and tablets will find everything they expect in a device.Update 11/8/13: I still think the Kindle Fire is a fantastic product, and I use it occasionally for games. However, I have gone back to my Kindle Keyboard for reading novels. The arthritis in my shoulders, elbows, and hands has  worsened since I\\'ve been using the Kindle Fire, and even using the device for a short while increases the pain significantly. I can tolerate it for short periods to play a few games. However, I simply can\\'t hold the Kindle Fire long enough for reading. This won\\'t be an issue for most people, but I wanted to mention it for those people who might have similar problems.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6578420310105324, 'meta': {'split': 'train', 'question_id': '3ecfc76edee933ba1f202069b4fe7847', 'item_id': 'B0074BW614'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '219ce93058383db5659102424e34a094'}>],\n"," 'no_ans_gap': 13.715798139572144,\n"," 'node_id': 'Reader',\n"," 'params': {'Reader': {'top_k': 3},\n","            'Retriever': {'filters': {'item_id': ['B0074BW614'],\n","                                      'split': ['train']},\n","                          'top_k': 3}},\n"," 'query': 'Is it good for reading?',\n"," 'root_node': 'Query'}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"iryo26-srfq3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728802954096,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":118,"user":{"displayName":"Aman Kushwaha","userId":"01248588024895850919"}}},"execution_count":46,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["imporving pipeline\n","1st step is to make our retriver better\n","reader(REDINg comprehension model) does not matter if the docs are not relevent to the user query\n","\n","\n","---\n","how to measure the performance of retriever\n","- metric -> recall\n"," - weather the ans is presnent in the passage or not\n","\n"," - Count how many times ans appear in the topk doc return by the retriver\n","\n","NOTE to myself:\n","- passage => silding window over the context"],"metadata":{"id":"-2ooyqk41VgI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["You're right to seek clarification on this point.

Open-domain QA:\n","   - Documents are not typically associated with specific products.\n","   - Each document can cover a wide range of topics or information.\n","   - Documents might be encyclopedia articles, news articles, web pages, or any general text.\n","   - There's no inherent product-based structure to the document collection.\n","\n","2. Closed-domain QA:\n","   - Documents are focused on a specific domain or topic, but still not usually associated with individual products.\n","   - For example, in a medical QA system, documents might be medical textbooks, research papers, or clinical guidelines.\n","   - The domain is restricted, but documents aren't tied to specific products.\n","\n","3. SubjQA-like datasets:\n","   - Here, each document is associated with a single product.\n","   - This is a more specialized structure, often used in e-commerce or product review scenarios.\n","   - For example, a document might be a collection of reviews or specifications for a particular product.\n","\n","The key difference is in the organization and purpose of the documents:\n","\n","- In open and most closed-domain systems, documents are independent units of information.\n","- In product-specific datasets like SubjQA, documents have an additional layer of organization, being tied to specific products.\n","\n","This product-specific structure requires special handling during evaluation, as you might want to test if the retriever can find the correct document not just based on relevance to the query, but also based on its association with the correct product.

They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they're good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer's sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they're very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn't find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \\\"comfort zone\\\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn't get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn't catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it's good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you're into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I've certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we're talking about value, they're a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you're trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there's really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

The Sony MDRV6 excells as the best value of any headphone that I've ever owned.  They are especially good at producing natural-sounding deep bass, and the overall octave-to-octave balance is excellent.  The sound quality is all in all comparable to other headphones that cost considerably more.The MDRV6 is especially well-suited for travel due to the collapsible design, and for noisy environments or for quiet environments such as a library where the sound emitted by open-back headphones would distract others.The MDRV6 is not quite as comfortable as some other headphones, but the comfort can be improved enormously by replacing the pads with the velour pads from BeyerDynamic.  The pads that come on the MDRV6 have a non-breathable cover, and significant additional discomfort is caused by the way that the thin foam cover is glued to the pad around the inner circumference of the pad, which prevents the top and back of your ear from slipping into the space between the pad and the face of the headphone.  This forces the pad to rest on the back of the ear, which compresses the ear and eventually becomes uncomfortable.  I read on a web forum where several people had replaced the pads (which eventually come apart) with a velour pad made by BeyerDynamic, and after I did this replacement on my one pair that had a damaged pad, the increase in comfort was so great that I immediately did the other pair.  The thin cover can be glued down to the headphone face if needed to hold it in place, which then allows the top and rear of your ear to naturally  slide under the inner circumference of the pad, which is considerably more comfortable.  I can recommend this trivial modification without reservation to anyone who owns these headphones.  Even if you don't replace the pads with the BeyerDynamic velour pads, I suggest removing the pads anyway, then carefully separating the thin cover from the pad, and glueing the cover directly to the headphone surface.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'meta': {}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'score': None, 'embedding': None}, 'is_correct_answer': True, 'is_correct_document': True, 'origin':

'I have had Koss headphones in the past, Pro 4AA and QZ-99.  The Koss Portapro is portable AND has great bass response.  The work great with my Android phone and can be \"rolled up\" to be carried in my motorcycle jacket or computer bag without getting crunched.  They are very light and do not feel heavy or bear down on your ears even after listening to music with them on all day.  The sound is night and day better than any ear-bud could be and are almost as good as the Pro 4AA.  They are \"open air\" headphones so you cannot match the bass to the sealed types, but it comes close. For $32, you cannot go wrong.',\n"," 'd476830bf9282e2b9033e2bb44bbb995': 'To anyone who hasn\\'t tried all the various types of headphones, it is important to remember exactly what these are: cheap portable on-ear headphones. They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they\\'re good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer\\'s sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they\\'re very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn\\'t find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \"comfort zone\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn\\'t get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn\\'t catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it\\'s good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you\\'re into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I\\'ve certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I\\'d rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we\\'re talking about value, they\\'re a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you\\'re trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there\\'s really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection.',\n"," '455575557886d6dfeea5aa19577e5de4': \"I have had many sub-$100 headphones from $5 Panasonic to $100 Sony, with Sennheiser HD 433, 202, PX100 II (I really wanted to like these PX100-II, they were so very well designed), and even a Grado SR60 for awhile.  And what it basically comes down to is value.  I have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range, easily the best under $75.  I can't believe they're over 25 years old.It's hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull.  I listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country, and these headphones are suitable for all types of music.  The only fault in the sound is the bass.  It's just a *slight* bit boomy, but you get to like it after a while to be honest.The design is from the 80s as you all have probably figured out.  It could use a update but it seems like Koss has tried to perfect this formula and failed in the past.  I don't really care about the looks or the way it folds up or the fact that my hair gets caught up in it (I have very short hair, even for a male).But despite it's design flaws, it's the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, and the best part is that it's also the best sounding pair of headphones I have ever heard under $75.If you can get over the design flaws or if sound is the most important feature of headphones for you, there is nothing even close to this at this price range.This one is an absolute GEM.  I loved these so much I ordered two of the 25th Anniversary ones for a bit more.Update: I read some reviews about the PX100-II being much improved and better sounding than the PortaPro.  Since the PX100-II is relatively new, I thought I'd give it another listen.  This time I noticed something different.  The sound is warm, mellow, and neutral, but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes.  I still prefer higher-detail Portapro, but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the PX100-II.Oh by the way the Portapro comes in the straight plug now, not the angled plug anymore.  It's supposed to be for better compatibility with the iPods and iPhones out there.\",\n"," '6895a59b470d8feee0f39da6c53a92e5': 'My sister\\'s Bose headphones finally died and so, her being a super audiophile without enough money to buy the high-end stuff, i gave her my JVC HA-RX700 and she loves them even more than the Bose. So that left me with nothing, and therefore i decided to undertake the quest to find the best headphones for under $50 that I could. I looked at so many headphones, and i still loved my JVC\\'s, but i decided i should probably try something new. and then i found these...I would say that I am...an untrained-audiophile of sorts and have just recently started to be pickier about my headphones. i can pick out minute differences in music and how headphones represent them if i really want to, but it doesn\\'t exactly \"bother\" me terribly when bass is muddy or treble is harsh, etc. That being said, i loved my JVC\\'s and was sad to see them go, but I\\'ve gotta say, i love these bad boys even more. I think it\\'s the bass that separates them...it\\'s punchier and more...accurate, you know? without being overly done. out of the box they had a bit too much sibilance (i think that\\'s the right word), but they\\'ve broken in a bit and it\\'s less harsh in that range. but the bass...wow. otherwise they\\'re very similar in my opinion to the JVC\\'s. The treble might be a tad better, but not much if at all. I don\\'t know enough of the proper wording to describe much more about it, but that\\'s my two cents. They\\'re also very comfortable, not too tight or anything and very soft padding. I highly recommend them, i can\\'t imagine headphones getting that much better. i\\'ve heard Beats by Dre, Bose, and the JVCs, and these are just the best of all of them to me.',\n"," '7a2173c502da97c5bd5950eae7cd7430': \"Wow. Just wow. I'm a 22 yr old with a crazy obsession with sound and music. Audiophile? Maybe. These headphones are so perfect in every way. The sound is so crisp, clear and clean, the design is awesome and simple and the materials are very high quality. They are so comfortable even for my sensitive ears. The bass is just absolutely perfect, not choppy or muddy at all. Forget the Beats, forget the Souls by Ludacris, save yourself the money and get higher quality at half the price. There's no surprise that these have been so widely used for almost 30 years. The included adapter is perfect because it allows me to use these cans in my iPhone and home audio system which is also 100% Sony, I just love their audio hardware.\"}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":105}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["product = dfs['train'].query(\"title == 'B00001P4ZH'\")"],"metadata":{"id":"WCiIGsTvxGCh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728805033868,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":510,"user":{"displayName":"Aman Kushwaha","userId":"01248588024895850919"}}},"execution_count":112,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["product"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":406},"id":"u6YT09VRzcBb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728805037174,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Aman Kushwaha","userId":"01248588024895850919"}},"outputId":"9cfbc83b-5941-4e41-fedf-19adf9cfbdce"},"execution_count":113,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        domain   nn_mod         nn_asp   query_mod query_asp  \\\n","0  electronics    great  bass response   excellent      bass   \n","1  electronics    harsh           high  not strong      bass   \n","2  electronics  neutral          sound     present      bass   \n","\n","                       q_reviews_id  question_subj_level  ques_subj_score  \\\n","0  0514ee34b672623dff659334a25b599b                    5              0.5   \n","1  7c46670208f7bf5497480fbdbb44561a                    1              0.5   \n","2  8fbf26792c438aa83178c2d507af5d77                    1              0.5   \n","\n","   is_ques_subjective                         review_id  \\\n","0               False  882b1e2745a4779c8f17b3d4406b91c7   \n","1               False  ce76793f036494eabe07b33a9a67288a   \n","2               False  d040f2713caa2aff0ce95affb40e12c2   \n","\n","                                 id       title  \\\n","0  2543d296da9766d8d17d040ecc781699  B00001P4ZH   \n","1  d476830bf9282e2b9033e2bb44bbb995  B00001P4ZH   \n","2  455575557886d6dfeea5aa19577e5de4  B00001P4ZH   \n","\n","                                             context  \\\n","0  I have had Koss headphones in the past, Pro 4A...   \n","1  To anyone who hasn't tried all the various typ...   \n","2  I have had many sub-$100 headphones from $5 Pa...   \n","\n","                              question  \\\n","0                     How is the bass?   \n","1  Is this music song have a goo bass?   \n","2                     How is the bass?   \n","\n","                                        answers.text answers.answer_start  \\\n","0                                                 []                   []   \n","1  [Bass is weak as expected, Bass is weak as exp...

They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they\\'re good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer\\'s sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they\\'re very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn\\'t find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \"comfort zone\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn\\'t get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn\\'t catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it\\'s good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you\\'re into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I\\'ve certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I\\'d rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we\\'re talking about value, they\\'re a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you\\'re trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there\\'s really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection.'},\n"," {'qas': [{'question': 'How is the bass?',\n","    'id': '455575557886d6dfeea5aa19577e5de4',\n","    'is_impossible': False,\n","    'answers': [{'text': 'The only fault in the sound is the bass',\n","      'answer_start': 650}]}],\n","  'context': \"I have had many sub-$100 headphones from $5 Panasonic to $100 Sony, with Sennheiser HD 433, 202, PX100 II (I really wanted to like these PX100-II, they were so very well designed), and even a Grado SR60 for awhile.  And what it basically comes down to is value.  I have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range, easily the best under $75.  I can't believe they're over 25 years old.It's hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull.  I listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country, and these headphones are suitable for all types of music.  The only fault in the sound is the bass.  It's just a *slight* bit boomy, but you get to like it after a while to be honest.The design is from the 80s as you all have probably figured out.  It could use a update but it seems like Koss has tried to perfect this formula and failed in the past.  I don't really care about the looks or the way it folds up or the fact that my hair gets caught up in it (I have very short hair, even for a male).But despite it's design flaws, it's the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, and the best part is that it's also the best sounding pair of headphones I have ever heard under $75.If you can get over the design flaws or if sound is the most important feature of headphones for you, there is nothing even close to this at this price range.This one is an absolute GEM.  I loved these so much I ordered two of the 25th Anniversary ones for a bit more.Update: I read some reviews about the PX100-II being much improved and better sounding than the PortaPro.  Since the PX100-II is relatively new, I thought I'd give it another listen.  This time I noticed something different.  The sound is warm, mellow, and neutral, but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes.  I still prefer higher-detail Portapro, but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the PX100-II.Oh by the way the Portapro comes in the straight plug now, not the angled plug anymore.

Dicts/s]WARNING:haystack.modeling.data_handler.processor:Answer 'These earbuds are nothing special. Their best attribute is that they are cheap. The sound from them is nothing special. In comparison to my standard white IPod buds these seem to emphasize the higher frequencies. There seems to be nothing happening in the bass range with these. I don't think they are efficient enough to have much bass at all. To be fair, my IPod buds overly emphasize bass so they are not that accurate either. I also compared these to a pricy Sennheiser set that I've owned for a couple of years and let's just say there is a reason why the Sennheisers cost more.Surely these Panasonic buds are very nice to use if you think they might get damaged somehow in use as it will not break your heart to have to replace them. These might be especially useful if you only listen to talk radio or have high frequency hearing loss. If you really like to listen to the most of your music and you must wear earbuds then these are not for you.I also have to note that these are packaged in a difficult to open blister pack that required several passes with utility shears to break into. I hate to see all the plastic that has to be discarded just to get this product out of the package.Cosmetically, they are OK. They don't hurt my ears and are comfortable to me. They come with a couple of other size ear pieces if you are hard to fit. The wires take a set when folded so they are not very well-behaved and don't coil nicely and lie flat when you put them away. These will be a little bird's nest of tangled wires when you set them aside.

Dicts/s]WARNING:haystack.modeling.data_handler.processor:Answer 'These earbuds are nothing special. Their best attribute is that they are cheap. The sound from them is nothing special. In comparison to my standard white IPod buds these seem to emphasize the higher frequencies. There seems to be nothing happening in the bass range with these. I don't think they are efficient enough to have much bass at all. To be fair, my IPod buds overly emphasize bass so they are not that accurate either. I also compared these to a pricy Sennheiser set that I've owned for a couple of years and let's just say there is a reason why the Sennheisers cost more.Surely these Panasonic buds are very nice to use if you think they might get damaged somehow in use as it will not break your heart to have to replace them. These might be especially useful if you only listen to talk radio or have high frequency hearing loss. If you really like to listen to the most of your music and you must wear earbuds then these are not for you.I also have to note that these are packaged in a difficult to open blister pack that required several passes with utility shears to break into. I hate to see all the plastic that has to be discarded just to get this product out of the package.Cosmetically, they are OK. They don't hurt my ears and are comfortable to me. They come with a couple of other size ear pieces if you are hard to fit. The wires take a set when folded so they are not very well-behaved and don't coil nicely and lie flat when you put them away. These will be a little bird's nest of tangled wires when you set them aside.
